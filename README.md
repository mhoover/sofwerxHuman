## Topic: Human Performance Optimization
The modern warfighter undegoes numerous offline assessments and has access to the latest in biosensing wearables. Combining these disparate streams of information to provide a holistic picture of a warfighter's health is the objective of BUDDY (Biometrics Utilizing Data & Diagnoses for You).

The concept of BUDDY is simple -- take the various streams of psychological, biological, and sociological data that are collected, normalize and weight them, and identify an easily trackable and understood score for the warfighter and unit leaders. The BUDDY Score can help the warfighter know how they stand in terms of peak performance and can helps leaders make smart decisions with regards to their team.

## Documents of interest
Most of this GitHub repository is code generated during the SOFWERX/MD5 Hacking the Human Element hackathon in Tampa, FL. Code includes:
* C code to extract data from wearable tech (in particular, the Pebble watch)
* Java code to develop a mobile Android app
* Python code to transform (and generate, where necessary) data for calculating the BUDDY score.
